    abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new method for non-linear pairwise registration of point sets. In this method, we consider the points of the first set as the draws of a Gaussian mixture model whose centres are the points of the second set displaced by a deformation. Next we perform {\it maximum a posteriori} estimation of the parameters (which include the unknown transformation) of this model using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. Compared to other methods using the same ''EM-ICP'' paradigm/framework, we propose three key modifications leading to an efficient algorithm allowing for fast registration of large point sets: 1) symmetrisation of the point-to-point correspondences; 2) specification of priors on these correspondences using differential geometry; 3) efficient encoding of deformations using the RKHS theory and the Fourier analysis. The resulting algorithm is efficient and is able to register large data sets. We evaluate the added value of the modifications and compare our method to the state-of-the-art CPD algorithm on synthetic data.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a set of new generic automated processing tools to characterise the local asymmetries of anatomical structures (represented by surfaces) at an individual level, and within/between populations. The building bricks of this toolbox are: 1) a new algorithm for robust, accurate, and fast estimation of the symmetry plane of grossly symmetrical surfaces, and 2) a new algorithm for the fast, dense, non-linear matching of surfaces. This last algorithm is used both to compute dense individual asymmetry maps on surfaces, and to register these maps to a common template for population studies. We show these two algorithms to be mathematically well-grounded, and provide some validation experiments. Then we propose a pipeline for the statistical evaluation of local asymmetries within and between populations. Finally we present some results on real data.}},

@article{Corouge03a,
	Abstract = {Within the scope of three-dimensional brain imaging, we propose an
	inter-individual fusion scheme to register functional activations
	according to anatomical cortical structures, the sulci. This paper
	is based on the assumption that an important part of the functional
	inter-subject variability is encoded in the anatomical variability.
	Therefore, we aim in this paper at proposing a generic framework
	to register functional activations according to relevant anatomical
	landmarks. Compared to "classical" inter-individual fusion schemes,
	this approach is local. It relies on a statistical sulci shape model
	accounting for the inter-individual variability of a population
	of subjects, and providing deformation modes relatively to a reference
	shape (a mean sulcus). The deformation field obtained between a
	given sulcus and the reference sulcus is extended to a neighborhood
	of the given sulcus by using the thin-plate spline interpolation.
	It is then applied to functional activations located in the vicinity
	of this sulcus. This approach is compared with rigid and non rigid
	registration methods. We present in this paper results on MEG somatosensory
	data acquired on 18 subjects. We show that the non-linear local
	fusion scheme signicantly reduces the functional variability after
	registration.},

	Abstract = {3D freehand ultrasound is a technique based on the acquisition of
	non parallel Bscans whose position in 3D space is known by a 3D
	localizer (optic or magnetic) attached to the probe. From these
	irregularly distributed B-scans and their positions, a regular 3D
	lattice volume can be reconstructed. This reconstruction step may
	be needed to apply conventional 3D computer vision algorithms like
	volumetric registration and segmentation, but is still an acute
	problem with regards to computation time and reconstruction quality.
	In this paper, a new 3D reconstruction method is presented, taking
	explicitly into account the 3D probe trajectory. Experiments were
	conducted on di
erent data sets (phantom and intra-operative sequences)
	with various probe motion types and average distance between two
	consecutive B-scans. Results indicate that this technique outperforms
	other classical methods at the expense of a slight computational
	increase.},

@article{Jannin03,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Improvement of the planning stage of image-guided surgery
	requires a better anticipation of the surgical procedure and its
	anatomical and functional environment. This anticipation should
	be provided by acquisition of multimodal medical images of the patient
	and by a better understanding of surgical procedures. In this paper,
	we propose improvements to the planning and performance of multimodal
	image-guided neurosurgery through the use of information models
	related to neurosurgical procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new
	generic model of surgical procedures is introduced in the context
	of multimodal image-guided craniotomies. The basic principle of
	the model is to break down the surgical procedure into a sequence
	of steps defining the surgical script. In the model, a step is defined
	by an action. The model assigns to each surgical step a list of
	image entities extracted from multimodal preoperative images (i.e.,
	anatomical and/or functional images) which are relevant to the performance
	of that particular step. A semantic validation of the model was
	performed by instantiating the model entities for 29 surgical procedures.
	RESULTS: The resulting generic model is described by a UML class
	diagram and a textual description. The validation showed the relevance
	of the model, confirming the main underlying assumptions. It also
	provided some leads to improve the model. CONCLUSION: While further
	validation is needed, the initial benefits of this approach can
	already be outlined. It should add real value to the different levels
	of image-guided surgery, from preprocessing to planning, as well
	as during surgery. Models of surgical procedures can manage image
	data according to the surgical script, which should lead to better
	anticipation of surgery through the development of simulation tools.
	Furthermore, the models may improve the performance of surgery using
	microscope-based neuronavigation systems by making it possible to
	adapt both visualization and interaction features of multimodal
	preoperative images according to the model.},

	Abstract = {Displaying anatomical and physiological information derived from preoperative
	medical images in the operating room is critical in image-guided
	neurosurgery. This paper presents a new approach referred to as
	augmented virtuality (AV) for displaying intraoperative views of
	the operative field over three-dimensional (3-D) multimodal preoperative
	images onto an external screen during surgery. A calibrated stereovision
	system was set up between the surgical microscope and the binocular
	tubes. Three-dimensional surface meshes of the operative field were
	then generated using stereopsis. These reconstructed 3-D surface
	meshes were directly displayed without any additional geometrical
	transform over preoperative images of the patient in the physical
	space. Performance evaluation was achieved using a physical skull
	phantom. Accuracy of the reconstruction method itself was shown
	to be within 1 mm (median: 0.76 mm<tex>$pm$</tex>0.27), whereas
	accuracy of the overall approach was shown to be within 3 mm (median:
	2.29 mm<tex>$pm$</tex>0.59), including the image-to-physical space
	registration error. We report the results of six surgical cases
	where AV was used in conjunction with augmented reality. AV not

	Abstract = {A number of problems frequently encountered in brain image analysis
	can be conveniently solved within a registration framework, such
	as alignment of mono- or multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Images
	(MRI) for single or multiple subjects, computation of the cerebral
	mid-sagittal plane in anatomical or diffusion-tensor MRI, correction
	of acquisition distortions in diffusion-weighted MRI, etc. A widely
	used approach for registration tasks consists of maximising a similarity
	criterion between the intensities of the images to be matched. In
	this context, efficient optimisation methods are needed to obtain
	good performances. In this paper, we introduce a new optimisation
	algorithm (called NEWUOA) to address the above registration problems,
	and we demonstrate its robustness and accuracy properties},

@article{COUPE:2008:INRIA-00332014:1,
	Abstract = {A critical issue in image restoration is the problem of noise removal
	while keeping the integrity of relevant image information. Denoising
	is a crucial step to increase image quality and to improve the performance
	of all the tasks needed for quantitative imaging analysis. The method
	proposed in this paper is based on a 3-D optimized blockwise version
	of the nonlocal (NL)-means filter (Buades et al., 2005). The NL-means
	filter uses the redundancy of information in the image under study
	to remove the noise. The performance of the NL-means filter has
	been already demonstrated for 2-D images, but reducing the computational
	burden is a critical aspect to extend the method to 3-D images.
	To overcome this problem, we propose improvements to reduce the
	computational complexity. These different improvements allow to
	drastically divide the computational time while preserving the performances
	of the NL-means filter. A fully automated and optimized version
	of the NL-means filter is then presented. Our contributions to the
	NL-means filter are: 1) an automatic tuning of the smoothing parameter;
	2) a selection of the most relevant voxels; 3) a blockwise implementation;
	and 4) a parallelized computation. Quantitative validation was carried
	out on synthetic datasets generated with BrainWeb (Collins et al.,
	1998). The results show that our optimized NL-means filter outperforms
	the classical implementation of the NL-means filter, as well as
	two other classical denoising methods [anisotropic diffusion (Perona
	and Malik, 1990)] and total variation minimization process (Rudin
	et al., 1992) in terms of accuracy (measured by the peak signal-to-noise
	ratio) with low computation time. Finally, qualitative results on
	real data are presented},
